## 📍 The Process

This project was built by applying concepts learned in **Section 20 and Section 21 of The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp**.

In Section 20, jQuery was introduced as a way to simplify common JavaScript and DOM operations. This included selecting elements using `$()`, manipulating text and attributes, adding and removing CSS classes, and handling events such as `click` and `keydown`. Basic animations like fade effects were also explored.

In Section 21, these concepts were applied to build a complete Simon game. Game logic was implemented to generate and store a sequence of colors, track user input, compare patterns, and handle game-over states. jQuery animations and sound effects were used to give the game a retro feel and provide clear feedback to the player.
